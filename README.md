# Deepview-Competition

This repository contains the submission for Team 6 BBSD (Brian, Benyamin, Sam, and Dennis) for UBC Data Science Club's Deepview Computer Vision Hackathon which was held in collaboration with Dark Vision. We have included the two notebooks we created for data preprocessing, our model, and Lisa Y. W. Tang's model from a previous iteration of the competition. For additional context, we also included the competition outline and our presentation slide deck.
